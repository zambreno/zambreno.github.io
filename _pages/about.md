<h3> Brief Biography</h3>
Joseph A. Zambreno has been with the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.iastate.edu) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu) since 2006, where he currently holds the Ross Martin Mehl and Marylyne Munas [Mehl Professorship](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/the-department/endowments/mehl-professorship/) in Computer Engineering. He also serves as the Director for Undergraduate Education for the department and is director of the Reconfigurable Computing Lab ([RCL](https://rcl.ece.iastate.edu)). From 2018 to 2023 he served as the Associate Chair for the department. Prior to joining ISU he was at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, where he graduated with his Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2006, his M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2002, and his B.S. degree summa cum laude in Computer Engineering in 2001. While at Northwestern University, Dr. Zambreno was a recipient of a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship, the Northwestern University Graduate School Fellowship, the Walter P. Murphy Fellowship, and the EECS department Best Dissertation Award for his Ph.D. dissertation titled "Compiler and Architectural Approaches to Software Protection and Security." He is a recent recipient of the NSF CAREER award ([2012](https://news.engineering.iastate.edu/2012/06/21/the-frontiers-of-computer-architecture/)), as well as the ISU award for Early Achievement in Teaching ([2012](https://www.inside.iastate.edu/article/2012/09/20/awards)), the College of Engineering Outstanding Achievement in Teaching Award ([2019](https://news.engineering.iastate.edu/2019/09/19/cyclone-engineering-faculty-and-staff-honored-for-contributions-to-college/)), and the ECpE department's Warren B. Boast undergraduate teaching award (2009, 2011, 2016).

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
Computer architecture, compilers, embedded systems, and hardware/software co-design, with a separate focus on run-time reconfigurable architectures and compiler techniques for software protection. More generally, I am interested in application acceleration, including the design and implementation of optimized FPGA architectures, GPU systems, and other embedded platforms for various real-world domains such as cryptography, image and video processing, and machine learning.
