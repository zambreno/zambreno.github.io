	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are an emerging type of airborne traffic under active research expected to carry cargo and passengers in the future over dense population centers. One challenge is identifying algorithms which can compactly represent and navigate the available airspace while avoiding conflict with buildings and other UAS. In this paper, we explore a decentralized method coupling a medial axis graph for global navigation through the city with local collision avoidance of buildings and other UAS to obtain collision-free efficient navigation through an urban environment. We study trade-offs of using Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA), Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT and RRT*), and Fast Markov Decision Process (FastMDP) as the collision avoidance algorithms. We examine low-altitude UAS navigating through a portion of New York City dense with skyscrapers to study the effectiveness of the algorithms in a challenging environment. We show that ORCA, RRT, RRT*, and FastMDP all are fairly efficient for 2D problems, but as the problem becomes more realistic (3D, constrained motion, aware of other UAS), FastMDP provides the best overall performance among the four algorithms studied.},

	abstract = {Cryptographic hash functions play a critical role in ensuring the security and veracity of network transactions; for example, they constitute the backbone of hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs), distributed hash tables (DHTs), and blockchain. However, cryptographic hashing can incur significant CPU overhead, especially for applications that commonly process large inputs exceeding 1 MB. This can make it infeasible to implement HMACs, DHTs, etc. in resource-constrained embedded systems or servers with strict response time requirements.\&nbsp; As a solution, we present an FPGA architecture to accelerate SipHash, a promising cryptographic hash function.\&nbsp; Our design constitutes the first SipHash implementation that targets maximum performance on an FPGA. The proposed architecture\&$\#$39;s throughput and acceleration vs. software were measured on Xilinx\&$\#$39;s Zynq-7000 and Ultrascale+ SoCs for a wide range of input sizes.\&nbsp; These results show one core can provide single-threaded throughput of up to 13.7 Gbps on a modern FPGA fabric, and multiple parallel cores can exceed 100 Gbps, allowing applications like blockchain and peer-to-peer file sharing to scale with emerging high-bandwidth networks.\&nbsp; A single core can keep pace with 10 Gigabit Ethernet, and further parallelization can empower FPGA designs to fully utilize higher network bandwidths.},

	year = {2022},
	abstract = {Multiple aircraft collision avoidance is a challenging problem due to a stochastic environment and uncertainty in the intent of other aircraft. Traditionally a layered approach to collision avoidance has been employed using a centralized air traffic control system, established rules of the road, separation assurance, and last minute pairwise collision avoidance. With the advent of Urban Air Mobility (air taxis), the expected increase in traffic density in urban environments, short time scales, and small distances between aircraft favor decentralized decision making on-board the aircraft. In this paper, we present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based method, named FastMDP, which can solve a certain subclass of MDPs quickly, and demonstrate using the algorithm online to safely maintain separation and avoid collisions with multiple aircraft (1-on-n) while remaining computationally efficient. We compare the FastMDP algorithm\&rsquo;s performance against two online collision avoidance algorithms that have been shown to be both efficient and scale to large numbers of aircraft: Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our simulation results show that under the assumption that aircraft do not have perfect knowledge of other aircraft intent FastMDP outperforms ORCA and MCTS in collision avoidance behavior in terms of loss of separation and near mid-air collisions while being more computationally efficient. We further show that in our simulation FastMDP behaves nearly as well as MCTS with perfect knowledge of other aircraft intent. Our results show that FastMDP is a promising algorithm for collision avoidance that is also computationally efficient.},

	abstract = {The smart city landscape is rife with opportunities for mobility and economic optimization, but also presents many security concerns spanning the range of components and systems in the smart ecosystem. One key enabler for this ecosystem is smart transportation and transit, which is foundationally built upon connected vehicles. Ensuring vehicular security, while necessary to guarantee passenger and pedestrian safety, is itself challenging due to the broad attack surfaces of modern automotive systems. A single car contains dozens to hundreds of small embedded computing devices known as electronic control units (ECUs) executing 100s of millions of lines of code; the inherent complexity of this tightly-integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the key problems that frustrates effective security. We describe an approach to help reduce the complexity of security analyses by leveraging unsupervised machine learning to learn clusters of messages passed between ECUs that correlate with changes in the CPS state of a vehicle as it moves through the world. Our approach can help to improve the security of vehicles in a smart city, and can leverage smart city infrastructure to further enrich and refine the quality of the machine learning output.},

	abstract = {Developing efficient embedded vision applications requires exploring various algorithmic optimization trade-offs and a broad spectrum of hardware architecture choices. This makes navigating the solution space and finding the design points with optimal performance trade-offs a challenge for developers. To help provide a fair baseline comparison, we conducted comprehensive benchmarks of accuracy, run-time, and energy efficiency of a wide range of vision kernels and neural networks on multiple embedded platforms: ARM57 CPU, Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU and Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. Each platform utilizes their optimized libraries for vision kernels (OpenCV, VisionWorks and xfOpenCV) and neural networks (OpenCV DNN, TensorRT and Xilinx DPU). For vision kernels, our results show that the GPU achieves an energy/frame reduction ratio of 1.1\&ndash;3.2x compared to the others for simple kernels. However, for more complicated kernels and complete vision pipelines, the FPGA outperforms the others with energy/frame reduction ratios of 1.2\&ndash;22.3x. For neural networks [Inception-v2 and ResNet-50, ResNet-18, Mobilenet-v2 and SqueezeNet], it shows that the FPGA achieves a speed up of [2.5, 2.1, 2.6, 2.9 and 2.5]x and an EDP reduction ratio of [1.5, 1.1, 1.4, 2.4 and 1.7]x compared to the GPU FP16 implementations, respectively.},

	month = {July},
	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in many computer vision tasks. However, their intensive storage, bandwidth and computational requirements limit their deployment to embedded platforms. Although several research efforts have shown that pruning redundant weights could significantly reduce storage and computations, working with sparse weights remains challenging. The irregular computation of sparse weights and the overhead of managing their representation limit the efficiency of the underlaying hardware. To address these issues, we propose a hardware-friendly pruning algorithm that generates structured sparse weights. In this algorithm, locations of non-zero weights are derived on-chip in real-time using Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) to eliminate the overhead of managing sparse weight representations. In this paper, we also propose a hardware inference engine for sparse convolution on FPGAs. It uses LFSRs to localize non-zero weights within weights tensors and avoids copying sparse weights indices by generating them on-chip. Experimental results show that the proposed pruning method can reduce the size of VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 models by 80\%, 76\% and 65\% with less than 2\% accuracy loss. Experiments also demonstrate that our accelerator can achieve 456-534 effective GOPs for the modern CNNs on Xilinx ZCU102, which provides a 1.2-2.7x; speedup over previous sparse CNN accelerators on FPGAs.

We demonstrate a parallelized implementation of the algorithm on a Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) and show the level of performance and scaling that can be achieved. Our results show that on commodity GPU hardware we can perform flight plan scheduling against 2000-3000 known flight plans and with server-class hardware the performance can be higher. Our results show promise for implementing a large scale UAM scheduler capable of performing on-demand flight scheduling that would be suitable for both centralized or distributed flight planning systems.

	volume = {92},
	year = {2020},
	abstract = {While neural network models keep scaling in depth and computational requirements, biologically accurate models are becoming more interesting for low-cost inference. Coupled with the need to bring more computation to the edge in resource-constrained embedded and IoT devices, specialized ultra-low power accelerators for spiking neural networks are being developed. Having a large variance in the models employed in these networks, these accelerators need to be flexible, user-configurable, performant and energy efficient. In this paper, we describe CyNAPSE, a fully digital accelerator designed to emulate neural dynamics of diverse spiking networks. Since the use case of our implementation is primarily concerned with energy efficiency, we take a closer look at the factors that could improve its energy consumption. We observe that while majority of its dynamic power consumption can be credited to memory traffic, its on-chip components suffer greatly from static leakage. Given that the event-driven spike processing algorithm is naturally memory-intensive and has a large number of idle processing elements, it makes sense to tackle each of these problems towards a more efficient hardware implementation. With a diverse set of network benchmarks, we incorporate a detailed study of memory patterns that ultimately informs our choice of an application-specific network-adaptive memory management strategy to reduce dynamic power consumption of the chip. Subsequently, we also propose and evaluate a leakage mitigation
strategy for runtime control of idle power. Using both the RTL implementation and a software simulation of CyNAPSE, we measure the relative benefits of these undertakings. Results show that our adaptive memory management policy results in up to 22\% more reduction in dynamic power consumption.},

	month = {September},
	abstract = {Robonaut2 (R2) is a humanoid robot onboard the International Space Station (ISS), performing specialized tasks in collaboration with astronauts. After deployment, R2 developed an unexpected emergent behavior. R2's inability to distinguish between knee-joint faults (e.g., due to sensor drift versus violated environmental assumptions) began triggering mid-task, safety-preserving freezes-in-place in the confined space of the ISS, preventing further motion until a ground-control operator determines the root-cause and initiates proper corrective action. Runtime verification (RV) algorithms can efficiently disambiguate the temporal signatures of different faults in real-time. However, no previous RV engine can operate within the limited available resources and specialized platform constraints of R2's hardware architecture. An attempt to deploy the only runtime verification engine designed for embedded flight systems, R2U2, failed due to resource constraints. We present a significant redesign of the core R2U2 algorithms to adapt to severe resource and certification constraints and prove their correctness, time complexity, and space requirements. We further define optimizations enabled by our new algorithms and implement the new version of R2U2. We encode specifications describing real-life faults occurring onboard Robonaut2 using MLTL and detail our process of specification debugging, validation, and refinement. We deploy this new version of R2U2 on Robonaut2, demonstrating successful real-time fault disambiguation and mitigation triggering of R2's knee-joint faults without false positives.},

To address this risk, we introduce a novel algorithm to extract the real-time model parameters of the CAN bus and develop SAIDuCANT, a specification-based intrusion detection system (IDS) using anomaly-based supervised learning with the real-time model as input.We evaluate the effectiveness of SAIDuCANT with real CAN logs collected from two passenger cars and on an open source CAN dataset collected from real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that SAIDuCANT can effectively detect data injection attacks with low false positive rates and outperforms other detection approaches using the timing features of CAN messages.},

	abstract = {The automotive Controller Area Network (CAN) allows Electronic Control Units (ECUs) to communicate with each other and control various vehicular functions such as engine and braking control. Consequently CAN and ECUs are high priority targets for hackers. As CAN implementation details are held as proprietary information by vehicle manufacturers, it can be challenging to decode and correlate CAN messages to specific vehicle operations. To understand the precise meanings of CAN messages, reverse engineering techniques that are time-consuming, manually intensive, and require a physical vehicle are typically used. This work aims to address the process of reverse engineering CAN messages for their functionality by creating a machine learning classifier that analyzes messages and determines their relationship to other messages and vehicular functions. Our work examines CAN traffic of different vehicles and standards to show that it can be applied to a wide arrangement of vehicles. The results show that the function of CAN messages can be determined without the need to manually reverse engineer a physical vehicle.  },

	abstract = {Spiking neural networks are viable alternatives to classical neural networks for edge processing in low-power embedded and IoT devices. To reap their benefits, neuromorphic network accelerators that tend to support deep networks still have to expend great effort in fetching synaptic states from a large remote memory. Since local computation in these networks is event-driven, memory becomes the major part of the system{\textquoteright}s energy consumption. In this paper, we explore various opportunities of data reuse that can help mitigate the redundant traffic for retrieval of neuron meta-data and post-synaptic weights. We describe CyNAPSE, a baseline neural processing unit and its accompanying software simulation as a general template for exploration on various levels. We then investigate the memory access patterns of three spiking neural network benchmarks that have significantly different topology and activity. With a detailed study of locality in memory traffic, we establish the factors that hinder conventional cache management philosophies from working efficiently for these applications. To that end, we propose and evaluate a domain-specific management policy that takes advantage of the forward visibility of events in a queue-based event-driven simulation framework. Subsequently, we propose network-adaptive enhancements to make it robust to network variations. As a result, we achieve 13-44\% reduction in system power consumption and 8-23\% improvement over conventional replacement policies.},

These memory bugs enable attackers to leak sensitive information, hijack program control flow, or otherwise compromise the system and are a critical concern for computer security. Many runtime monitoring and protection approaches have been proposed to detect memory errors in C and C++ applications, however, they require source code recompilation or binary instrumentation, creating compatibility challenges for applications using proprietary or closed source code, libraries, or plug-ins. This paper introduces a new approach for detecting heap memory errors that does not require applications to be recompiled or instrumented. We show how to leverage the calling convention of a processor to track all dynamic memory allocations made by an application during runtime. We also present a transparent tracking and caching architecture to efficiently verify program heap memory accesses. Performance simulations of our architecture using SPEC benchmarks and real-world application workloads show our architecture achieves hit rates over 95\% for a 256-entry cache, resulting in only 2.9\% runtime overhead. Security analysis using a software prototype shows our architecture detects 98\% of heap memory errors from selected test cases in the Juliet Test Suite and real-world exploits.},

Solutions have been proposed to target mobile platforms like smart phones and tablets by making use of the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) camera commonly found on those platforms. These solutions tend to be slower than the former due to the reduced performance available in mobile processors.

	abstract = {A hardware/software configurable architecture for Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control is presented, which is a combination of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control law with a Discrete Kalman Filter (DKF) state estimator. LQG controllers are ideal candidates for hardware acceleration, since the DKF algorithm requires matrix inversion, which is time consuming and potentially parallelizable. In this design, a functionally equivalent DKF method, called the Sequential Discrete Kalman Filter (SDKF), is used to transform the matrix inversion into an iterative scalar inversion. The proposed design acts as an Intellectual Property (IP) Core, where the user can adjust scaling parameters in hardware and configuration parameters in software to tailor the given architecture to a wide range of physical systems. This differentiates the proposed design from other LQG implementations since it is not application specific; in fact, this architecture, which was targeted for a Xilinx Zynq-7020 FPGA, allows for systems of state size 4 to 128 and achieves a speedup of 23.6 to 167 over a 2.7GHz quad-core processor. The goal of this approach is to support a design methodology for bridging the gap between control theory and embedded systems applications. For evaluation, this architecture was compared to a pure software LQG implementation. Additionally, the approach and results of recent LQG and LQG-related hardware designs were analyzed and compared to the proposed design.},

	month = {August},
	abstract = {
A modern Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) utilizes L1 Data (L1D) caches to reduce memory bandwidth requirements and latencies. However, the L1D cache can easily be overwhelmed by many memory requests from GPU function units, which can bottleneck GPU performance. It has been shown that the performance of L1D caches is greatly reduced for many GPU applications as a large amount of L1D cache lines are replaced before they are re-referenced. By examining the cache access patterns of these applications, we observe L1D caches with low associativity have difficulty capturing data locality for GPU applications with diverse reuse patterns. These patterns result in frequent line replacements and low data re-usage.

To improve the efficiency of L1D caches, we design a Dynamic Line Protection scheme (DLP) that can both preserve valuable cache lines and increase cache line utilization. DLP collects data reuse information from the L1D cache. This information is used to predict protection distances for each memory instruction at runtime, which helps maintain a balance between exploitation of data locality and over-protection of cache lines with long reuse distances. When all cache lines are protected in a set, redundant cache misses are bypassed to reduce the contention for the set. The evaluation result shows that our proposed solution improves cache hits while reducing cache traffic for cache-insufficient applications, achieving up to 137\% and an average of 43\% IPC improvement over the baseline.},

	abstract = {Feature description is an essential component of many computer vision applications. It encodes the visual contents of images in a manner that is robust against various image transformations. Computing these descriptors is computationally expensive, which causes a performance bottleneck in many embedded vision systems. Although many hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate feature description computation, most target a single feature description algorithm under specific constraints. The lack of flexibility of such implementations increases development effort if deployed applications need to be modified or upgraded. In this paper, we propose a software configurable hardware architecture capable of computing different types of histogram-based feature descriptors without the need for re-synthesizing the hardware. The architecture takes advantage of data streaming to reduce the computational complexity of computing this class of descriptor. To illustrate the efficiency of our architecture, we deploy two of the most commonly used descriptors (SIFT and HOG) and compare their quality with software implementations. The architecture is also evaluated in terms of execution speed and resource usage and compared with dedicated hardware architectures. Our flexible architecture shows a speed up of 3x and 5x compared to state-of-the-art dedicated hardware architectures for SIFT and HOG, with resource usage overheads [LUTs, FFs, and DSPs] of [1.1x, 15x, and 1.6x] and [6.4x, 7x, and 32x] for SIFT and HOG, respectively.},

Via software, an embedded systems engineer can easily reconfigure the controller to suit a wide range of controls applications that can be represented as a state-space model. One goal of our approach is to support a design methodology to help bridge the gap between controls and embedded system software engineering. Control of the well-understood inverted pendulum on a cart is used as an illustrative example of how the proposed hardware accelerator architecture supports our envisioned design methodology for helping bridge this gap. Additionally, we explore the design space of our co-processor{\textquoteright}s parallel architecture in terms of computing speed and resource utilization. Our performance results show a 3.4 to 100 factor speedup over a 666 MHz embedded ARM processor, for plants that can be represented by 4 to 128 states respectively.

	abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular advanced model-based control algorithm for controlling systems that must respect a set of system constraints (e.g. actuator force limitations). However, the computing requirements of MPC limits the suitability of deploying its software implementation into embedded controllers requiring high update rates. This paper presents a scalable embedded MPC controller implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) coupled with an on-chip ARM processor. Our architecture implements an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) approach for computing MPC controller commands. All computations are performed using floating-point arithmetic. We introduce a software/hardware (SW/HW) co-design methodology, for which the ARM software can configure on-chip Block RAM to allow users to 1) configure the MPC controller for a wide range of plants, and 2) update at runtime the desired trajectory to track. Our hardware architecture has the flexibility to compromise between the amount of hardware resources used (regarding Block RAMs and DSPs) and the controller computing speed. For example, this flexibility gives the ability to control plants modeled by a large number of decision variables (i.e. a plant model using many Block RAMs) with a small number of computing resources (i.e. DSPs) at the cost of increased computing time. The hardware controller is verified using a Plant-on-Chip (PoC), which is configured to emulate a mass-spring system in real-time. A major driving goal of this work is to architect an SW/HW platform that brings FPGAs a step closer to being widely adopted by advanced control algorithm designers for deploying their algorithms into embedded systems.},

	abstract = {Sliding window is one of the most commonly used techniques in image processing algorithms. Implementing it in hardware requires buffering image rows on-chip to exploit data locality and avoid redundant off-chip pixel transfers. However, scaling this architecture to large window sizes or high resolutions linearly increases on-chip memory utilization. This imposes limitations on porting many image processing algorithms into hardware efficiently. In this paper, we propose a new sliding window architecture that utilizes less on-chip memory resources while maintaining performance as compared to the traditional method. The proposed architecture exploits that most natural images have smooth color variations with fine details in between these variations to compress images. It decomposes non-zero image pixels into their wavelet components and represents each wavelet coefficient with a minimum number of bits. The architecture is also flexible to use lossless or lossy compression based on a configurable threshold value. The FPGA implementation of our proposed architecture shows memory saving of 25-70\% compared to the traditional architecture using lossless compression, and for lossy compression with up to a mean square error of 5 achieves up to 84\% in memory savings.},

	abstract = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become a prevalent platform for high throughput general purpose computing. The peak computational throughput of GPUs has been steadily increasing with each technology node by scaling the number of cores on the chip. Although this vastly improves the performance of several compute-intensive applications, our experiments show that some applications can achieve peak performance without utilizing all cores on the chip. We refer to the number of cores at which performance of an application saturates as the optimal number of active cores (Nopt). We propose executing the application on Nopt cores, and power-gating the unused cores to reduce static power consumption.

Towards this target, we present ONAC (Optimal Number of Active Cores detector), a runtime technique to detect Nopt. ONAC uses a novel estimation model, which significantly reduces the number of hardware samples taken to detect the optimal core count, compared to a sequential detection technique (SeqDet). We implement ONAC and Seq-Det in a cycle-level GPU performance simulator and analyze their effect on performance, power and energy. Our evaluation shows that ONAC and Seq-Det can reduce energy consumption by 20\% and 10\% on average for memory-intensive applications, without sacrificing more than 2\% performance. The higher energy savings for ONAC comes from reducing the detection time by 45\% as compared to Seq-Det.},

	abstract = {The Kalman Filter is a robust tool often employed as a plant observer in control systems. However, in the general case the high computational cost, especially for large system models or fast sample rates, makes it an impractical choice for typical low-power microcontrollers. Industry trends towards tighter integration and subsystem consolidation point to the use of powerful high-end SoCs, but this complicates the ability for a controls engineer to verify correct behavior of the system under all conditions, which is important in safety-critical systems.

Dedicated FPGA hardware can provide computational speedup, in addition to firmer design partitioning in mixed-criticality systems and fully deterministic timing, which helps ensure a control system behaves as close as possible to offline simulations. We introduce and compare two variants of a software-configurable FPGA-based implementation of a Kalman Filter. The first is an implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter, while the second is a novel approach{\textendash}the Piecewise-Affine Kalman Filter{\textendash}which may offer significant advantages for certain types of applications.

The state estimate update time and resource requirements are analyzed for plant models up to 28 states. For large models, the designs provide a speedup of 7-12x compared to reference ARM9020T software implementations. An application-agnostic performance analysis demonstrates how the Piecewise-Affine Kalman Filter reduces the software workload and the communication overhead compared to the standard mixed hardware-software Extended Kalman Filter approach.},

Since no two cells have precisely the same properties, for applications involving large batteries this can severely limit the accuracy and utility of the approach. In this paper we develop an model-driven approach using a Dual Unscented Kalman Filter to allow a Battery Monitoring System (BMS) to monitor in real time both SOC and SOH of each cell in a battery. A BMS is an example of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) which requires deep understanding of the behavior of the physical system (i.e., the battery) in order to obtain reliability in demanding applications. In particular, since the SOH of a cell changes extremely slowly compared to SOC, our dual filter operates on two timescales to improve SOH tracking. We show that the use of the Unscented Kalman Filter instead of the more common Extended Kalman Filter simplifies the development of the system model equations in the multiscale case. We also show how a single {\textquotedblleft}average{\textquotedblright} cell model can be used to accurately estimate SOH for different cells and cells of different ages.

WPA, however, still has some flaws that allow an attacker to obtain the passphrase. One of these flaws is exposed when the access point (AP) is operating in the WPA personal mode. This is the most common mode, as it is the  quickest and easiest to configure. This vulnerability requires the attacker to capture the traffic from the four-way handshake between the AP and client, and then have enough compute time to reverse the passphrase. Increasing the rate at which passphrases can be reversed reduces the amount of time required to construct a repository of service set identifiers (SSIDs) and passphrases, which can increase the chances an attack is successful, or, alternatively, reduce the difficulty of auditing a wireless network for security purposes. This work focuses on creating a Field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based architecture to accelerate the generation of a WPA/WPA2 pairwise master key (PMK) lookup table (LUT) for the recovery of  the passphrase, with special emphasis on the secure hash algorithm-1 (SHA-1) implementation.

As GPU architectures are optimized for throughput, they execute a large number of SIMD threads (warps) in parallel and use hardware multithreading to hide the pipeline and memory access latencies. While the Two-Level Round Robin (TLRR) and Greedy Then Oldest (GTO) warp scheduling policies have been widely accepted in the  academic research community, there is no consensus regarding which policy works best for all applications. 

In this paper, we show that the disparity regarding which scheduling policy works better depends on the characteristics of instructions in different regions (phases) of the application. We identify these phases at compile time and design a novel warp scheduling policy that uses information regarding them to make scheduling decisions at runtime. By mitigating the adverse effects of application phase behavior, our policy always performs closer to the better of the two existing policies for each application. We evaluate the performance of the warp schedulers on 35 kernels from the Rodinia and CUDA SDK benchmark suites. For applications that have a better performance with the GTO scheduler, our warp scheduler matches the performance of GTO with 99.2\% accuracy and achieves an average speedup of 6.31\% over RR. Similarly, for applications that perform better with RR, the performance of our scheduler is within of 98\% of RR and achieves an average speedup of 6.65\% over GTO.},

Teaching undergraduate students to understand concepts and technologies behind embedded systems is important in order to prepare these future engineers with the skills and expertise necessary for designing such complex systems. This paper describes an undergraduate course designed to introduce students to embedded system design concepts and challenges in an engaging and effective manner. Our course uses a combination of in-depth laboratory assignments and topical lectures to provide a unique hands-on education for students. Laboratory assignments utilize Avnet{\textquoteright}s ZedBoard platform, a development board built around Xilinx{\textquoteright}s Zynq-7000 SoC, and require students to solve a variety of embedded system challenges from a range of application domains. Overall, student feedback about the course has been positive.},

	abstract = {With the increase in the complexity of models and lack of flexibility offered by the analog computers, coupled with the advancements in digital hardware, the simulation industry has subsequently moved to digital computers and increased usage of programming languages such as C, C++, and MATLAB. However, the reduced time-step required to simulate complex and fast systems imposes a tighter constraint on the time within which the computations have to be performed. The sequential execution of these computations fails to cope with the real-time constraints which further restrict the usefulness of Real-Time Simulation (RTS) in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. In this paper, we present a methodology for the design and implementation of RTS algorithms, based on the use of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. We apply our methodology to an 8th order steering valve subsystem of a vehicle with relatively low response time requirements and use the FPGA technology to improve the response time of this model. Our methodology utilizes traditional hardware/software co-design approaches to generate a heterogeneous architecture for an FPGA-based simulator by porting the computationally complex regions to hardware. The hardware design was optimized such that it efficiently utilizes the parallel nature of FPGAs and pipelines the independent operations. Further enhancement was made by building a hardware component library of custom accelerators for common non-linear functions. The library also stores the information about resource utilization, cycle count, and the relative error with different bit-width combinations for these components, which is further used to evaluate different partitioning approaches. In this paper, we illustrate the partitioning of a hardware-based simulator design across dual FPGAs, initiate RTS using a system input from a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) framework, and use these simulation results from our FPGA-based platform to perform response analysis. The total simulation time, which includes the time required to receive the system input over a socket (without HIL), software initialization, hardware computation, and transfer of simulation results back over a socket, shows a speedup of 2x as compared to a similar setup with no hardware acceleration. The correctness of the simulation output from the hardware has also been validated with the simulated results from the software-only design.},

Previous approaches for scaling memory cores come at the cost of operating frequency, communication overhead, and logic resources without increasing the storage  capacity of the memory. In this paper, we present two approaches for designing multi-port memory cores that are suitable for reconfigurable accelerators with substantial on-chip memory or complex communication. Our design approaches tackle these challenges by banking RAM blocks and utilizing interconnect networks which allows scaling without sacrificing logic resources. With banking, memory congestion is unavoidable and we evaluate our multi-port memory cores under different memory access patterns to gain insights about different design trade-offs. We demonstrate our implementation with up to 256 memory ports using a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. Our experimental results report high throughput memories with resource usage that scales with the number of ports.

Shared memory not only leads to worst-case execution time (WCET) pessimism, but also affects the response time of safety critical tasks. In this paper, we present a criticality aware cache design which implements a Least Critical (LC) cache replacement policy, where a least recently used non-critical cache line is replaced during a cache miss. The cache acts as a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache if there are no critical lines or if all cache lines are critical in a set. In our design, data within a certain address space is given higher preference in the cache. These critical address spaces are configured using critical address range (CAR) registers. The new cache design was implemented in a Leon3 processor core, a 32bit processor compliant with the SPARC V8 architecture. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the impact of the Least Critical cache replacement policy on the response time of critical tasks, and on overall application performance as compared to a conventional LRU cache policy.},

The high computational complexity of SVD poses challenges for efficient signal processing and data analysis systems, especially for time-sensitive applications with large data sets. While the emergence of FPGAs provides a flexible and low-cost opportunity to pursue high-performance SVD designs, the classical two-sided Jacobi rotation-based SVD architectures are restricted in terms of scalability and input matrix representation. The Hestenes-Jacobi algorithm offers a more parallelizable solution to analyze arbitrary rectangular matrices; however, to date both FPGA and GPU-based implementations have not lived up to the algorithm{\textquoteright}s potential. In this paper, we introduce a floating-point Hestenes-Jacobi architecture for SVD, which is capable of analyzing arbitrary sized matrices. Our implementation on an FPGA-based hybrid acceleration system demonstrates improved efficiency of our architecture compared to an optimized software-based SVD solution for matrices with small to medium column dimensions, even with comparably large row dimensions. The dimensional speedups can be achieved range from 3.8x to 43.6x for matrices with column dimensions from 128 to 256 and row sizes from 128 to 2048.

This response time jitter can result in reduced system stability, motivating further study by both the controls and computing communities to maximize CPU utilization, while maintaining physical system stability needs.

In this paper, we present a hybrid priority queue architecture that includes a hardware accelerated binary heap that can also be managed in software when its queue size exceeds hardware limits. A memory mapped interface provides software with access to priority-queue-structured on-chip memory, which enables quick and low overhead transitions between hardware and software management.

	abstract = {Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) achieve latency tolerance by exploiting massive amounts of thread level parallelism. Each core executes several hundred to a few thousand simultaneously active threads. The work scheduler tries to maximize the number of active threads on each core by launching threads until at least one of the required resources is completely utilized. The rationale is, more threads would give the thread scheduler more opportunities to hide memory latency and thus would result in better performance. In this work, we show that launching the maximum number of threads is not always necessary to achieve the best performance. Applications have an optimal thread count value at which the performance saturates. Increasing the number of threads beyond this value results in no better and sometimes worse performance. To this end, we develop Perf-Sat: a mechanism to detect the optimal number of threads required on each core at runtime. Perf-Sat is integrated into the hardware work scheduler and guides it to either increase or decrease the number of active threads. We evaluate the performance impact of our scheduler on two GPU generations and show that Perf-Sat scales well to different applications as well as architectures. With performance loss of less than 1\%, Perf-Sat is able to achieve core resource savings of 18.32\% on average.},

	abstract = {QR decomposition has been widely used in many signal processing applications to solve linear inverse problems. However, QR decomposition is considered a computationally expensive process, and its sequential implementations fail to meet the requirements of many time-sensitive applications. The Householder transformation and the Givens rotation are the most popular techniques to conduct QR decomposition. Each of these approaches have their own strengths and weakness. The Householder transformation lends itself to efficient sequential implementation, however its inherent data dependencies complicate parallelization. On the other hand, the structure of Givens rotation provides many opportunities for concurrency, but is typically limited by the availability of computing resources. We propose a deeply pipelined reconfigurable architecture that can be dynamically configured to perform either approach in a manner that takes advantage of the strengths of each. At runtime, the input matrix is first partitioned into numerous submatrices. Our architecture then performs parallel Householder  transformations on the sub-matrices in the same column block, which is followed by parallel Givens rotations to annihilate the remaining unneeded individual off-diagonals. Analysis of our design indicates the potential to achieve a performance of 10.5 GFLOPS with speedups of up to 1.46x, 1.15x and 13.75x compared to the MKL implementation, a recent FPGA design and a Matlab solution, respectively.},

Cell-level energy balancing is commonly proposed as a means to address the effects of cell property mismatch. However, no comprehensive solution exists addressing the need to maintain SOC accuracy over the full life of a large battery, while also managing the energy imbalance which develops between cells. If poorly managed, this imbalance can reduce usable capacity and lifespan.

It also avoids the stable orbits of logistic map giving a more chaotic behavior to the system. A stream cipher is built using MLM and random feedback scheme. The proposed cipher gives 16 bits of encrypted data per clock cycle. The hardware implementation results over Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA give a synthesis clock frequency of 93 MHz and a throughput of 1.5 Gbps while using 16 hardware multipliers.

	abstract = {The field of modern control theory and the systems used to implement these controls have shown rapid development over the last 50 years. It was often the case that those developing control algorithms could assume the computing medium was solely dedicated to the task of controlling a plant. For example, the control algorithm being implemented in software on a dedicated digital signal processor (DSP), or implemented in hardware using a simple dedicated programmable logic device (PLD). As time progressed, the drive to place more system functionality in a single component (reducing power, cost, and increasing reliability) has made this assumption less often true. Thus, it has been pointed out by some experts in the field of control theory (e.g. Astrom) that those developing control algorithms must take into account the effects of running their algorithms on systems that will be shared with other tasks. One aspect of the work presented is this article is a hardware architecture that allows control developers to maintain this simplifying assumption. We focus specifically on the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. An on-chip coprocessor has been implemented that can scale to support servicing hundreds of plants, while maintaining microsecond level response times, tight deterministic control loop timing, and allows the main processor to service non-control tasks.

In order to control a plant, the controller needs information about the plant{\textquoteright}s state. Typically this information is obtained from sensors with which the plant has been instrumented. There are a number of
common computations that may be performed on this sensor data before being presented to the controller (e.g. averaging and thresholding). Thus in addition to supporting PID algorithms, we have developed a sensor processing unit (SPU) that off-loads these common sensor processing tasks from the main processor.

We have prototyped our ideas using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. Through our experimental results, we show our PID execution unit gives orders of magnitude improvement in response time when servicing many plants, as compared to a standard general software implementation. We also show that the SPU scales much better than a general software implementation. In addition, these execution units allow the simplifying assumption of dedicated computing medium to hold for control algorithm development.},

Joint multimedia compression and encryption techniques can significantly reduce the computational requirements of video processing systems. We present an approach to reduce the computational cost of multimedia encryption, while also preserving the properties of compressed video (useful for scalability, transcoding, and retrieval), which endanger loss by naive encryption. Hardware-amenable design of proposed algorithms makes them suitable for real-time embedded multimedia systems. This approach alleviates the need of additional hardware for encryption in resource constrained scenario, and can be otherwise used to augment existing encryption methods used for content delivery in Internet or other applications.

In this work, we show how two compression blocks for video coding: a modified frequency transform (called as Secure Wavelet Transform or SWT) and a modified entropy coding scheme, (called Chaotic Arithmetic Coding (CAC)) can be used for video encryption. Experimental results are shown for selective encryption using proposed schemes.},

	abstract = {Introducing programming using an imperative language often requires a steep learning curve due to the significant emphasis and corresponding time commitment placed on a particular language{\textquoteright}s syntax and semantics. This paper presents a suite of video game scripting engines focusing on nurturing computational skills that can be explored in as little as one hour. Scripting engines run code developed by students to control four concurrent players on a team; up to four teams (four different code scripts) can play in a head-to-head competition. To achieve a quick learning curve, the scripting engine only supports a limited number of instructions to define initial player qualities, movements, and game actions. Students are faced with the computational thinking challenge of mapping their game strategies into code. Successful strategies require teams to appreciate the complexities of concurrent programming to control all game players simultaneously. We have observed that students quickly learn that writing code for all team players individually does not result in a competitive match, but requires a mixture of collaboration and parallel programming to be competitive in a short amount of time. The need for more advanced control flow semantics are also motivated, since students must rewrite similar code for performing similar routines through the game simulation. The video game scripting engines have been used in two high school outreach programs and results from these events indicate that the learning objectives were met and students were engaged in the activities the entire duration by modifying their code to be more competitive. Lessons learned from the first scripting engine (Dodgeball) that went into creating the second engine ( Boomtown) are also presented.

	abstract = {In Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems, applications must dynamically adapt their behavior in response to objectives and conditions that change while deployed. One approach to achieve dynamic adaptation is to offer middleware that facilitates component migration between modalities in response to such dynamic changes. The triggering, planning, and cost evaluation of adaptation takes place within a scheduler. Scheduling overhead is a major limiting factor for implementing dynamic scheduling algorithms with high frequency timer-tick resolution in real time systems. In this paper, we present a scalable hardware scheduler architecture for real time systems that reduces processing overhead and improves timing predictability of the scheduler. A new hardware priority queue design is presented, which supports insertions in constant time, and removals in O(log n) time. The hardware scheduler supports three (Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS), Earliest Deadline First (EDF), priority based) scheduling algorithms, which can be configured during run-time. The interface to the scheduler is provided through a set of custom instructions as an extension to the processors instruction set architecture. We also report on our experience migrating between two implementations of an ordered-set implementation, with the goal of providing predictable performance for real-time applications.},

We have recently introduced a senior technical elective which introduces graphics processing from the perspective of the software developer, hardware architect, and system integrator. Towards this end, lecture topics are designed for students with no computer graphics background, and focus on solving specific computing problems using skills learned from a variety of computer engineering courses (e.g. digital logic, computer architecture, software design, embedded systems). As part of the laboratory component, students are presented with a series of bi-weekly design challenges that are geared towards implementing a particular module in the 3D graphics pipeline (with both hardware and software support) using an FPGA-based hardware prototyping platform. Although the main focus of the labs is on architectural design, hardware implementation, and hardware / software verification; each assignment also involves both a functional correctness as well as an optional performance optimization component. Only by analyzing the interactions between the graphics application, middleware, architecture, and logic levels can the performance optimization goal be achieved. Each subsequent challenge builds upon those previous, such that by the end of the semester students will have designed and implemented a fully-functional OpenGL-compliant graphics processor, capable of running significant applications. The course was introduced in the Spring of 2011 and the results from the final course project indicated that many of our intended learning objectives were met; student feedback was also positive. },

While the use of reconfigurable computing technology in a high-performance computing environment has shown recent promise in accelerating a wide variety of scientific applications, existing SMVM architectures on FPGA hardware have been limited in that they require either numerous pipeline stalls during computation (due to zero padding) or excessive input preprocessing during run-time. For large-scale sparse matrix scenarios, both of these shortcomings can result in unacceptable performance overheads, limiting the overall value of using FPGAs in a high-performance computing environment. In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient FPGA-based SMVM architecture which can handle arbitrary matrix sparsity patterns without excessive preprocessing or zero padding and can be dynamically expanded based on the available I/O bandwidth. Our experimental results using a commercial FPGA-based acceleration system demonstrate that our reconfigurable SMVM engine is highly efficient, with benchmark-dependent speedups over an optimized software implementation that range from 3.5x to 6.5x in terms of computation time.},

	abstract = {Many modern computing applications have been enabled through the use of real-time multimedia processing. While several hardware architectures have been proposed in the research literature to support such primitives, these fail to address applications whose performance and resource requirements have a dynamic aspect. Embedded multimedia systems typically need a power and computation efficient design in addition to good compression performance. In this paper, we introduce a Polymorphic Wavelet Architecture (Poly-DWT) as a crucial building block towards the development of embedded systems to address such challenges. We illustrate how our Poly-DWT architecture can potentially make dynamic resource allocation decisions, such as the internal bit representation and the processing kernel, according to the application requirements. We introduce a filter switching architecture that allows for dynamic switching between 5/3 and 9/7 wavelet filters and leads to a more power efficient design. Further, a multiplier-free design with a low adder requirement demonstrates the potential of Poly-DWT for embedded systems. Through an FPGA prototype, we perform a quantitative analysis of our Poly-DWT architecture, and compare our filter to existing approaches to illustrate the area and performance benefits inherent in our approach.

In this paper, we present a methodology for the design and implementation of RTS algorithms, based on the use of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology to improve the response time of these models. Our methodology utilizes traditional hardware/software co-design approaches to generate a heterogeneous architecture for an FPGA-based simulator. The hardware design was optimized such that it efficiently utilizes the parallel nature of FPGAs and pipelines the independent operations. Further enhancement is obtained through the use of custom accelerators for common non-linear functions. Since the systems we examined had relatively low response time requirements, our approach greatly simplifies the software components by porting the computationally complex regions to hardware. We illustrate the partitioning of a hardware-based simulator design across dual FPGAs, initiate RTS using a system input from a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) framework, and use these simulation results from our FPGA-based platform to perform response analysis. The total simulation time, which includes the time required to receive the system input over a socket (without HIL), software initialization, hardware computation, and transfer of simulation results back over a socket, shows a speedup of 2x as compared to a similar setup with no hardware acceleration. The correctness of the simulation output from the hardware has also been validated with the simulated results from the software-only design.},

	abstract = {The mapping of many short sequences of DNA, called reads, to a long reference genome is an common task in molecular biology. The task amounts to a simple string search, allowing for a few mismatches due to mutations and inexact read quality. While existing solutions attempt to align a high percentage of the reads using small memory footprints, Shepard is concerned with only exact matches and speed. Using the human genome, Shepard is on the order of hundreds of thousands of times faster than current software  implementations such as SOAP2 or Bowtie, and about 60 times faster than GPU implementations such as SOAP3. 

Shepard contains two components: a software program to preprocess a reference genome into a hash table, and a hardware pipeline for performing fast lookups. The hash table has one entry for each unique 100 base pair sequence that occurs in the reference genome, and contains the index of last occurrence and the number of occurrences. To reduce the hash table size, a minimal perfect hash table is used. The hardware pipeline was designed to perform hash table lookups very quickly, on the order of 600 million lookups per second, and was implemented on a Convey HC-1 high  performance reconfigurable computing system. Shepard streams all of the short reads through a custom hardware pipeline and writes the alignment data (index of last occurrence and number of occurrences) to a binary results array.},

	abstract = {Thermal issues have resulted in growing concerns among industries fabricating various types of devices, such as Chip Multiprocessors (CMP) and reconfigurable hardware devices. Since passive cooling costs have risen considerably and packaging for worst-case is no longer practical, dynamic thermal management techniques are being devised to combat thermal effects. For such techniques to be applied effectively, it is necessary to accurately measure device temperatures at run time. Although several techniques have been proposed to measure the on-chip temperatures of reconfigurable devices, ring oscillators in many ways are a preferred choice due to their strong linear temperature-dependence and compact design using available spare reconfigurable resources.

A major problem in using ring-oscillators to measure temperature, however, is their strong dependence on the core voltage of, and current distribution throughout the device under test. One of the reasons for variations in these properties is changes in the workload running on the device. Researchers have seen large shifts in the output frequencies of ring-oscillators due to core voltage swings on reconfigurable devices, and have tried to find alternate ways of measuring temperature that attempt to mitigate these effects. The need, however, is to have a workload-compensated ring oscillator-based thermometer for reconfigurable devices. To obtain this, it is first necessary to characterize the non-ideal effects of workload variations on ring oscillator response. Where non-ideal refers to impacts on ring oscillator oscillation frequency due to phenomena other than the workload{\textquoteright}s impact on device temperature.

This paper performs such a characterization, in which the effects of workload variation on ring oscillator output frequency is quantified. A complete hardware-software setup is designed to collect temperature and power related data along with ring oscillator response to varying workload configurations. In addition, a potential issue with using the Xilinx System Monitor to measure die temperature at high ranges is also briefly discussed.},

It involves recursive partitioning of the range [0,1) in accordance with the relative probabilities of occurrence of the input symbols. In this paper, we present a data (image or video) encryption scheme based on arithmetic coding, which we refer to as Chaotic Arithmetic Coding (CAC). In CAC, a large number of chaotic maps can be used to perform coding, each achieving Shannon optimal compression performance. The exact choice of map is governed by a key. CAC has the effect of scrambling the intervals without making any changes to the width of interval in which the codeword must lie, thereby allowing encryption without sacrificing any coding efficiency. We next describe Binary CAC (BCAC) with some simple Security Enhancement (SE) modes which can alleviate the security of scheme against known cryptanalysis against AC-based encryption techniques. These modes, namely Plaintext Modulation (PM), Pair-Wise Independent Keys (PWIK), and Key and ciphertext Mixing (MIX) modes have insignificant computational overhead, while BCAC decoder has lower hardware requirements than BAC coder itself, making BCAC with SE as excellent choice for deployment in secure embedded multimedia systems.

	abstract = {Chaotic encryption schemes are believed to provide a greater level of security than conventional ciphers. In this paper, a chaotic stream cipher is first constructed and then its hardware implementation details using FPGA technology are provided. Logistic map is the simplest chaotic system and has a high potential to be used to design a stream cipher for real-time embedded systems. The cipher uses a pseudo-random sequence generator based on modified logistic map (MLM) and a random feedback scheme. MLM has better chaotic properties than the logistic map in terms of uniformity of bifurcation diagram and also avoids the stable orbits of logistic map, giving a more chaotic behavior to the system. The proposed cipher gives 16 bits of encrypted data per clock cycle. The hardware implementation results over Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA give a synthesis clock frequency of 93 MHz and a throughput of 1.5 Gbps while using 16 hardware multipliers. This makes the cipher suitable for embedded devices which have tight constraints on power consumption, hardware resources and real-time parameters.},

	year = {2010},
	month = {June},
	abstract = {Ray Tracing is a graphics rendering method that uses rays to trace the path of light in a computer model. To accelerate the processing of rays, scenes are typically compiled into smaller spatial boxes using a tree structure and rays then traverse the tree structure to determine relevant spatial boxes. This allows computations involving rays and scene objects to be limited to only objects close to the ray and does not require processing all elements in the computer model. 

We present a ray traversal pipeline designed to accelerate ray tracing traversal algorithms using a combination of currently used programmable graphics processors and a new fixed hardware pipeline. Our fixed hardware pipeline performs an initial traversal operation that quickly identifies a smaller sized, fixed granularity spatial bounding box from the original scene. This spatial box can then be traversed further to identify subsequently smaller spatial bounding boxes using any user-defined acceleration algorithm. We show that our pipeline allows for an expected level of user programmability, including development of custom data structures, and can support a wide range of processor architectures. The performance of our pipeline is evaluated for ray traversal and intersection stages using a kd-tree ray tracing algorithm and a custom simulator modeling a generic streaming processor architecture. Experimental results show that our pipeline reduces the number of executed instructions on a graphics processor for the traversal operation by 2.15X for visible rays. The memory bandwidth required for traversal is also reduced by a factor of 1.3X for visible rays.},

	abstract = {Wide Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) architectures often require a static allocation of thread groups that are executed in lockstep throughout the entire application kernel. Individual thread branching is supported by executing all control flow paths for threads in a thread group and only committing the results of threads on the current control path. While convergence algorithms are used to maximize processor efficiency during branching operations, applications requiring complex control flow often result in low processor efficiency due to the length and quantity of control paths. Global rendering algorithms are an example of a class of application that can be accelerated using a large number of independent parallel threads that each require complex control flow, resulting in comparatively low efficiency on SIMT processors. To improve processor utilization for global rendering algorithms, we introduce a SIMT architecture that allows for threads to be created dynamically at runtime. Large application kernels are broken down into smaller code blocks we call {\textmu}-kernels that dynamically created threads can execute. These runtime {\textmu}-kernels allow for the removal of branching statements that would cause divergence within a thread group, and result in new threads being created and grouped with threads beginning execution of the same {\textmu}-kernel. In our evaluation of SIMT processor efficiency for a global rendering algorithms, dynamic {\textmu}-kernels improved processor performance by an average of 1.4x.},

We then propose a modification of BAC in which the overall length within the range [0,1) allocated to each symbol is preserved, but the choice of map used to encode each symbol is based on a key. The encoder, referred to as Chaotic Binary Arithmetic Coder (CBAC), has the effect of scrambling the intervals without making any changes to the width of interval in which the codeword must lie, thereby allowing encryption without sacrificing any coding efficiency. We also present some some security enhancement features to show how they can alleviate the limitations of our technique against known cryptanalysis on BAC-based encryption schemes.},

	abstract = {Real-time simulation of dynamic vehicle system models is essential to facilitate advances in operator and hardware in the loop simulation and virtual prototyping. Real-time virtual reality-based simulation enables users to visualize and perceive the effect of their actions during the simulation. As model complexity is increased to improve the model fidelity, the computational requirements will also increase, thus increasing the challenge to meet real-time constraints. A distributed simulator architecture was developed for off-road vehicle dynamic models and 3D graphics visualization to distribute the overall computational load across multiple computational platforms. This architecture consisted of three major components: a dynamic model simulator, a virtual reality simulator, and an interface to controller and input hardware devices. The dynamic model simulator component was developed using Matlab/Simulink Real Time Workshop on a PC and also using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), which offered a highly parallel hardware platform. The simulator architecture reduced the computational load to an individual platform and increased the real-time simulation capability with complex off-road vehicle system models and controllers. The architecture was used to develop, simulate and visualize a tractor and towed implement steering dynamics model. The model also included a steering valve sub-system which contained very high frequency hydraulic dynamics and required 10 μs integration time step for numerical stability. The real-time simulation goal was not achievable for the model with this level of complexity when the PC-based simulator was used. However, the FPGA-based simulator achieved a real-time goal taking only 2 μs to complete one integration time step. },

Partial and selective encryption schemes have been proposed in the research literature, but these schemes significantly increase the computation cost leading to tradeoffs in system latency, throughput, hardware requirements and power usage. In this paper, we propose a lightweight multimedia encryption strategy based on a modified discrete wavelet transform (DWT) which we refer to as the secure wavelet transform (SWT). The SWT provides joint multimedia encryption and compression by two modifications over the traditional DWT implementations: (a) parameterized construction of the DWT and (b) subband re-orientation for the wavelet decomposition. The SWT has rational coefficients which allow us to build a high throughput hardware implementation on fixed point arithmetic. We obtain a zero-overhead implementation on custom hardware. Furthermore, a Look-up table based reconfigurable implementation allows us to allocate the encryption key to the hardware at run-time. Direct implementation on Xilinx Virtex FPGA gave a clock frequency of 60 MHz while a reconfigurable multiplier based design gave a improved clock frequency of 114 MHz. The pipelined implementation of the SWT achieved a clock frequency of 240 MHz on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA and met the timing constraint of 500 MHz on a standard cell realization using 45 nm CMOS technology.},

	abstract = {We present a novel combination of hardware (architecture) and software (compiler) techniques to support the safe execution of untrusted code. While other efforts focus on isolating processes, our approach isolates code and data at a function (as in, C function) level, to enable fine-grained protection within a process as needed for downloaded plugins, libraries, and modifications of open-source projects. Our solution also enforces timing restrictions to detect denial of service from untrusted code, and supports protection of dynamically allocated memory. Because bookkeeping data can become substantial (permission tables that at their finest granularity describe which memory words may be accessed by which functions), our solution employs a stack-structured bookkeeping mechanism that tracks the flow of execution and automatically dispenses with bookkeeping data when no longer needed. This approach also enables an architectural optimization to handle permissions for dynamically allocated memory, allowing heap blocks to be appropriately shared across the trust boundary. Tested across a suite of benchmarks, our solution had a worst case 12\% overhead and 3.5\% average overhead at the finest level of code granularity (every single function in its own unit of isolation). The overhead is easily reduced by using trace-driven analysis to combine functions into coarser-grained groups that share permissions.},

Many techniques have been proposed ranging from simple compiler modifications to full-scale re-engineering of computer systems architecture aimed at attack detection.

We propose an architectural approach to attack detection and recovery called rollback and huddle that monitors a program{\textquoteright}s execution with a lightweight attack-detection module while continuously checkpointing the system state. In the case of an attack, the program state is rolled back to a time before the attack occurred and an additional module is loaded to identify the source of the attack, repair the original vulnerability, and prevent future attacks. The simple hardware modules work alongside a standard computer architecture and aid in attack detection, checkpoint creation, and attack recovery.

Consequently, software implementations are used without any dedicated hardware acceleration. In this paper, we introduce a ray tracing method designed around hierarchical space subdivision schemes that reduces memory operations. In addition, parts of this traversal method can be performed in fixed hardware running in parallel with programmable graphics processors.

We used a custom performance simulator that uses our traversal method, based on a kd-tree, to compare against a conventional kd-tree. The system memory requirements and system memory reads are analyzed in detail for both acceleration structures. We simulated six benchmark scenes and show a reduction in the number of memory reads of up to 70 percent compared to current recursive methods for scenes with over 100,000 polygons.},

	abstract = {Much of modern software development consists of assembling together existing software components and writing the glue code that integrates them into a unified application. The term COTS-Based System (CBS) is often used to describe such applications, for which the components assembled are understood to be CommercialOff-The-Shelf (COTS) components written by a multitude of independent third parties. The manner of assembly in CBS includes full-source components that are integrated at compile-time, pure-binary libraries incorporated at loadtime, and plugins that are loaded into the application at execution time by the user. Because components have access to system resources, applications may crash due to faulty components or may be compromised by malicious components. In this paper, we ask the question: can hardware support the development and deployment of CBS by providing applications with a trusted platform for managing components and their interactions? We present an architecture that places each CBS component in a hardware-enforced container. The hardware then detects improper usage of system resources (unauthorized memory accesses or denial-of-service) and enables applications to undertake a hardware-supervised recovery procedure. Furthermore, the hardware also maintains a violation record to enable developers to recreate the violation for the purpose of debugging and further development. Taken together, the purpose of the architecture we propose is to enable executing untrusted CBS code on trusted hardware.},

Inspired by concepts made popular in the world of software debug, we propose the inclusion of extra on-chip hardware for the efficient storage and tracing of execution contexts. Upon the detection of some software protection violation, the application is restarted at the last known safe checkpoint (the rollback part). During this deterministic replay, an additional hw/sw module is then loaded that can increase the level of system monitoring, log more detailed information about any future attack source, and potentially institute a live patch of the vulnerable part of the software executable (the huddle part).

	abstract = {Previous works in computer architecture have mostly neglected revenue and/or profit, key factors driving any design decision. In this paper, we evaluate architectural techniques to optimize for revenue/profit. The continual trend of technology scaling and subwavelength lithography has caused transistor feature sizes to shrink into the nanoscale range. As a result, the effects of process variations on critical path delay and chip yields have amplified. A common concept to remedy the effects of variations is speedbinning, by which chips from a single batch are rated by a discrete range of frequencies and sold at different prices. An efficient binning distribution thus decides the profitability of the chip manufacturer. We propose and evaluate a cache-redundancy scheme called substitute cache, which allows the chip manufacturers to modify the number of chips in different bins. Particularly, this technique introduces a small fully associative array associated with each cache way to replicate the data elements that will be stored in the high latency lines, and hence can be effectively used to boost up the overall chip yield and also shift the chip binning distribution towards higher frequencies. We also develop models based on linear regression and neural networks to accurately estimate the chip prices from their architectural configurations. Using these estimation models, we find that our substitute cache scheme can potentially increase the revenue for the batch of chips by as much as 13.1\%},

	abstract = {Association Rules Mining (ARM) algorithms are designed to find sets of frequently occurring items in large databases. ARM applications have found their way into a variety of fields, including medicine, biotechnology, and marketing. This class of algorithm is typically very memory intensive, leading to prohibitive runtimes on large databases. Previous attempts at acceleration using custom or reconfigurable hardware have been limited, as many of the significant ARM algorithms were designed from a software developer{\textquoteright}s perspective and have features (e.g. dynamic linked lists, recursion) that do not translate well to hardware. In this paper we look at how we can accomplish the goal of association rules mining from a hardware perspective. We investigate a popular tree-based ARM algorithm (FP-growth), and make use of a systolic tree structure, which mimics the internal memory layout of the original software algorithm while achieving much higher throughput. Our experimental prototype demonstrates how we can trade memory resources on a software platform for computational resources on a reconfigurable hardware platform, in order to exploit a fine-grained parallelism that was not inherent in the original ARM algorithm.},

	abstract = {While research into building robust and survivable networks has steadily intensified in recent years, similar efforts at the application level and below have focused primarily on attack discovery, ignoring the larger issue of how to gracefully recover from an intrusion at that level. Our work attempts to bridge this inherent gap between theory and practice through the introduction of a new architectural technique, which we call rollback and huddle. Inspired by concepts made popular in the world of software debug, we propose the inclusion of extra on-chip hardware for the efficient storage and tracing of execution contexts. Upon the detection of some software protection violation, the application is restarted at the last known safe checkpoint (the rollback part). During this deterministic replay, an additional hw/sw module is then loaded that can increase the level of system monitoring, log more detailed information about any future attack source, and potentially institute a live patch of the vulnerable part of the software executable (the huddle part). Our experimental results show that this approach could have a practical impact on modern computing system architectures, by allowing for the inclusion of low-overhead software security features while at the same time incorporating an ability to gracefully recover from attack.},

	abstract = {Integrated circuits (ICs) are often produced in foundries that lack effective security controls. In these foundries, sophisticated attackers are able to insert malicious Trojan circuits that are easily hidden in the large, complex circuitry that comprises modern ICs. These so-called Trojan circuits are capable of launching attacks directly in hardware, or, more deviously, can facilitate software attacks. Current defense against Trojan circuits consists of statistical detection techniques to find such circuits before product deployment. The fact that statistical detection can result in false negatives raises the obvious questions: can attacks be detected post-deployment, and is secure execution nonetheless possible using chips with undetected Trojan circuits? In this paper we present the Secure Heartbeat And Dual-Encryption (SHADE) architecture, a compiler-hardware solution for detecting and preventing a subset of Trojan circuit attacks in deployed systems. Two layers of hardware encryption are combined with a heartbeat of off-chip accesses to provide a secure execution environment using untrusted hardware. The SHADE system is designed to complement pre-deployment detection techniques and to add a final, last-chance layer of security},

With the onset of gigabit networks, current generation networking components for NIDS will soon be insufficient for numerous reasons; most notably because the existing methods cannot support high-performance demands. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive medium to handle both high throughput and adaptability to the dynamic nature of intrusion detection. In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99\% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95\%. Moreover, using extensive pipelining and hardware parallelism, it can be shown that for realistic workloads, our architectures for FEM and outlier analysis achieve 21.25- and 23.76-Gb/s core throughput, respectively.},

Other approaches take to the opposite extreme and sacrifice security for the sake of this transparency. In this work we present an architecture for software protection that provides for a high level of both security and user transparency by utilizing field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology as the main protection mechanism. We demonstrate that by relying on FPGA technology, this approach can accelerate the execution of programs in a cryptographic environment, while maintaining the flexibility through reprogramming to carry out any compiler-driven protections that may be application-specific.},

A common concept to remedy the effects of variation is speed-binning, by which chips from a single batch are rated by a discrete range of frequencies. In this paper, we argue that under these conditions, architectural optimizations should consider their effect on the “batch” of microprocessors rather than aiming at increasing the performance of a single processor. We first show that the critical paths are mostly determined by the level 1 data caches on a set of manufactured microprocessors. Then, we propose three new microarchitectural techniques aimed at masking the effects of process variations on level 1 caches. The first two techniques allow individual highlatency cache lines spanning single or multiple sets to be disabled at the post-manufacture testing stage. The third approach introduces a small substitute cache associated with each cache way to replicate the data elements stored in the high latency lines. Our new schemes can be effectively used to boost up the overall chip yield and also shift the chip binning distribution towards higher frequencies. To make a quantitative comparison between the different schemes, we first define a metric called batchperformance that takes into account the chip yield and frequency of chips in each bin. We then analyze our proposed schemes and show that the resizing schemes and the substitute cache can increase the batch-performance by as much as 5.8\% and 11.6\%, respectively. },

Nevertheless, an insufficient amount effort has been placed into fully exploiting the tremendous amounts of parallelism intrinsic to FPGAs for this class of algorithms. In this paper, we focus on block cipher architectures and explore design decisions that leverage the multi-grained parallelism inherent in many of these algorithms. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach with a highly parallel FPGA implementation of the AES standard, and present results detailing the area/delay tradeoffs resulting from our design decisions.},

	abstract = {The growing importance attached to the security of software systems has focused considerable attention on various problems related to security in computing. A vast array of research efforts ranging from highly technical cryptographic techniques all the way to higher-level information policy are currently engaged in addressing the security needs of the next generation of computing infrastructure. This paper addresses the role that compilers and compiler research can play in this realm. Because they routinely extract useful program structure and transform code, compilers are uniquely positioned in some ways to have a direct impact in the creation of more secure software. These features, among others, together with a fresh approach towards software protection based on compilation, can result in more robust applications and computing infrastructures. This paper will review on-going efforts, explore future research directions and make the case for renewed attention in this important area at the intersection of compiler and security research},

Existing flow monitoring techniques are implemented in software, which are insufficient for real-time monitoring in high-speed networks. In this paper, we present the design of a flow monitoring scheme based on two-dimensional hash tables. Taking advantage of FPGA technology, we exploit the use of parallelism in our implementation for both accuracy and performance. We present four techniques based on this two-dimensional hash table scheme. Using a simulation environment that processes packet traces, our implementation can find flow information within 8% of the actual value while achieving link speeds exceeding 60 Gbps for a workload with constant packet sizes of 40 bytes.},

In this paper we explore the design decisions that lead to area/delay tradeoffs in a single-core AES FPGA implementation.

	pages = {1180},
	abstract = {Research into defense mechanisms for digital information has intensified in recent years, as malicious attacks on software systems have become a rapidly growing burden. The growing area of software protection attempts to address the problems of code understanding and code tampering along with related problems such as authorization. Our work focuses on the design and evaluation of an architecture for software protection that utilizes FPGAs as a run-time integrity enforcement engine.

Recent approaches to software protection tend to lie at two extremes of the security-performance spectrum. At one end are highly secure hardware approaches that require a substantial buy-in from hardware manufacturers [1]. The other end provides security by either mangling the code to make it less understandable or by burying checksums in unlikely places [2]. These extremes invite an approach that allows system designers to position themselves where they choose on the security-performance spectrum.

Our proposed method works as follows. The processor is supplemented with an FPGA-based secure hardware component that is capable of fast decryption and can also recognize strings of keys hidden in plaintext instructions. The FPGA is situated between the highest level of on-chip cache and main memory in order to directly handle the instruction cache miss requests. These instructions would then be translated and verified in some fashion before the FPGA satisfies the cache request. An advantage to this approach is that the compiler's knowledge of program structure allows for tuning of the security and performance of individual applications. Also, the use of FPGAs minimizes additional hardware design and is applicable to a large number of commercial processor platforms. Our initial results demonstrate that the average performance penalty for this approach is not too severe for most applications.},

By coupling our protective compiler techniques with reconfigurable hardware support, we allow for a greater flexibility of placement on the security-performance spectrum than previously proposed mainly-hardware or software approaches. Results show that for most of our benchmarks, the average performance penalty of our approach is less than 20\%, and that this number can be greatly improved upon with the proper utilization of compiler and architectural optimizations.},

While traditional compiler techniques that target array-intensive applications can exploit intra-nest data reuse, there has not been much success in the past in taking advantage of internest data reuse. In this paper, we present a compiler strategy that optimizes inter-nest reuse using loop (iteration space) transformations. Our approach captures the impact of execution of a nest on cache contents using an abstraction called footprint vector. Then, it transforms a given nest such that the new (transformed) access pattern reuses the data left in cache by the previous nest in the code. In optimizing inter-nest locality, our approach also tries to achieve good intra-nest locality. Our simulation results indicate large performance improvements. In particular, inter-nest loop optimization generates competitive results with intra-nest loop and data optimizations},

We also show a simple metric that a power-optimizing compiler can utilize in order to capture the energy impact of potential optimizations. Next, we present heuristic algorithms that determine a suitable optimization strategy given a memory energy upper bound. Finally, we demonstrate that our strategies will gain even more importance in the future when leakage energy is expected to play an even larger role in the total energy consumption equation.},

	abstract = {One of the key problems facing the computer industry today is ensuring the integrity of end-user applications and data. Researchers in the relatively new field of software protection investigate the development and evaluation of controls that prevent the unauthorized modification or use of system software. While many previously developed protection schemes have provided a strong level of security, their overall effectiveness has been hindered by a lack of transparency to the user in terms of performance overhead. Other approaches take to the opposite extreme and sacrifice security for the sake of this transparency. In this work we present an architecture for software protection that provides for a high level of both security and user transparency by utilizing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology as the main protection mechanism and a hardware/software co-design methodology. We demonstrate that by relying on FPGA technology, this approach can accelerate the execution of programs in a cryptographic environment, while maintaining the flexibility through reprogramming to carry out any compiler-driven protections that may be application-specific. Results demonstrate that this framework can be the successful basis for the development of applications that meet a wide range of security and performance requirements},

Power issues are increasingly important in embedded systems, especially those found in portable devices. Much research has focused on the memory subsystems of these devices since they are a leading energy consumer. Compiler optimizations that are traditionally used to increase performance have shown much promise in also reducing cache energy consumption. However, many of these optimizations result in a tradeoff between a lower instruction count and a larger executable size, and it is not clear as to what extent these optimizations should be applied in order to meet power and performance constraints.

In this work, we present energy consumption models that we have modified for a memory hierarchy such as would be found in typical embedded systems. Using these models, we single out some optimizations that a power-aware compiler should focus on by examining the energy-reducing effect they have on various media and array-dominated benchmarks. We present a simple yet accurate metric that such a power-aware compiler can use in order to estimate the effect of potential optimizations on energy consumption. Next, we present heuristic algorithms that determine a suitable optimization strategy given a memory energy upper bound.
